                <p>As a Start-up advisor, it's my responsibility to provide guidance to small and mid-sized Start-up.I am also independently employed or work for some initial Start-up and try to support both new and established Start-up. Besides,as an Business advisor i try to provide financial and strategic advice to small and mid-sized Start-up. At minimum, I think a bachelor's degree is generally required for this job, but advisors must also have an excellent business sense and keen communication skills to transform the Start-up as a brand </p>
